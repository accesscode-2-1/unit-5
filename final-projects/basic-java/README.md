for the problems.


# Solutions

**Problem 1**: [`Pythagorean.java`](Pythagorean.java)

**Problem 2**: Most people chose to collect the numbers into a list, and then
find the largest and smallest; one solution looks like this:
[`MinMaxWithList.java`](MinMaxWithList.java).  You could also track the smallest
and largest while reading the input, without keeping a list of the numbers at
all, which looks like this: [`MinMax.java`](MinMax.java).

**Problem 3**: [`NumberGame.java`](NumberGame.java)

**Problem 4**: There are lots of ways you could track progress as the game
progresses.  Here's a solution that tracks the clue directly:
[`Hangman.java`](Hangman.java).
