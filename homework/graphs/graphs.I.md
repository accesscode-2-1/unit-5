1) Does [this graph](graphs/hw.euler.q1.png) contain an Euler circuit?
  * If so, list a sequence of vertices that define the Euler circuit.
  * If not, explain why not.

2) Does [this graph](graphs/hw.euler.q2.png) contain an Euler circuit? 
  * If so, list a sequence of vertices that define the Euler circuit.
  * If not, explain why not.

For the following two questions:
  * use [this template](graphs/adjacency.matrix.template.png) to draw your answer
  * take a picture and upload it to your repository
  * provide the link in your homework ticket

3) Draw the adjacency matrix for [this unweighted undirected graph](graphs/hw.unweighted.directed.png).

4) Draw the adjacency matrix for [this weighted directed graph](graphs/hw.weighted.directed.png).
